This one has arguments a a "title" and then the body:

.. note:: This is a note admonition.
   This is the second line of the first paragraph.

   - The note contains all indented body elements
     following.
   - It includes this bullet list.

.. admonition:: And, by the way...

   You can make up your own admonition too.

.. sample::

   This directive has no arguments, just a body.

An image with no body followed by one that has params and a body:

.. image:: picture.png

.. image:: picture.jpeg
   :height: 100px
   :width: 200 px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: alternate text
   :align: right

.. figure:: picture.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: map to buried treasure

   This is the caption of the figure (a simple paragraph).

   The legend consists of all elements after the caption.  In this
   case, the legend consists of this paragraph and the following
   table:

   +-----------------------+-----------------------+
   | Symbol                | Meaning               |
   +=======================+=======================+
   | .. image:: tent.png   | Campground            |
   +-----------------------+-----------------------+
   | .. image:: waves.png  | Lake                  |
   +-----------------------+-----------------------+
   | .. image:: peak.png   | Mountain              |
   +-----------------------+-----------------------+


.. topic:: Topic Title

    Subsequent indented lines comprise
    the body of the topic, and are
    interpreted as body elements.

Now a topic with a class, as used by testfixtures:

.. topic:: example.cfg
 :class: read-file

 ::

   [A Section]
   dir = frob

Another example:

.. sidebar:: Optional Sidebar Title
   :subtitle: Optional Sidebar Subtitle

   Subsequent indented lines comprise
   the body of the sidebar, and are
   interpreted as body elements.

Two directives next to each other:

.. skip:: next
.. code-block:: python

  run.append(1)

The following topic ens with two lines of whitespace, which is important:


.. topic:: example.cfg
 :class: read-file

 ::

   [A Section]
   dir = frob


.. config parser writes whitespace at the end, be careful when testing!
