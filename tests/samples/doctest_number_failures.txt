# ints shouldn't match floats:
>>> 3.0
3

>>> 3e0
3

>>> 1e3
1000

>>> 3
3.0

# Rounding:
>>> 3.1
3.0

>>> 3.1
3.2

>>> 3.1
4.0

>>> 8.22e5
810000.0

# Only the actual output is rounded up, not the expected output:
>>> 3.0
2.98

>>> 1e3
999

# The current implementation doesn't understand that numbers inside
# strings shouldn't be treated as numbers, however, you can work around with a comment:
>>> '3.1416'
'3.14'  # It is important that this matches exactly!
